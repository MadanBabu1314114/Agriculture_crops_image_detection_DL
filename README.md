This project utilizes deep learning with TensorFlow to detect and classify agricultural crops in images. The model is trained on a dataset of agricultural images, and it can be used to identify different types of crops in new images.

## Features

- **Crop Detection:** Identify the presence of crops in image.
- **Crop Classification:** Classify the detected crops into different categories.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (Install using `pip install tensorflow`)
- Other dependencies (Specify if there are additional dependencies)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:MadanBabu1314114/Agriculture_crops_image_detection_DL.git
