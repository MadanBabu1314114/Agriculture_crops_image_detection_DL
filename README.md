# Agriculture Crops Detection using TensorFlow


This project utilizes deep learning with TensorFlow to detect and classify agricultural crops in images. The model is trained on a dataset of agricultural images, and it can be used to identify different types of crops in new images.

## Features

- **Crop Detection:** Identify the presence of crops in images.
- **Crop Classification:** Classify the detected crops into different categories.
- **User Interface (Optional):** (Describe if your project has a user interface for easy interaction.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
